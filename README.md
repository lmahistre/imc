## Usage

This Firefox addon calculates the Body-Mass Index from two variables : height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms).

## Build and development

The Javascript bundle of the addon is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
NodeJS (version >= 14) is required for development.

Source files for Javascript and CSS are in the folder `src`. 
Files generated by build are in the `addon` folder. It contains the files for the Firefox addon. This folder is no longer present in the Git repository, it is fully generated by commands `npm run build` or `npm run publish`.

These files are generated:
* `img` folder: contains images
* `assets/app-[GENERATED_CODE].js`
* `assets/style-[GENERATED_CODE].css` 
* `index.html`
* `manifest.json`

First, install dependencies:

`npm install`

To build Javascript and CSS files and generate images and manifests for production (addon and site):

`npm run build`

To launch the development server:

`npm run dev`

The package for the addon is made from folder `addon`, which contains static files, manifest and html.
